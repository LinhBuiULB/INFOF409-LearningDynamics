# INFO-F409 - Learning Dynamics

## About the course 
The course addresses two general areas of research : individual-based learning and social learning in populations.

The first part focusses on learning through experience, of which reinforcement learning is the standard example. We start from a single agent setting and introduce reinforcement learning as a model free approach to dynamic programming. Then we have a look at the interplay of multiple learning agents in the same environment. For this purpose and for the following part on evolutionary dynamics, basic concepts of Game Theory are introduced.

The second part provides an introduction to the principles of learning by imitation, modelled through evolutionary dynamics. It will explain what evolution is and how games can be used to model interactions between individuals in a population. It will show how these models can be used to study the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas, the evolution of conventions like language or even the dynamics of cancer.

## About the assignments 

### Assignment 1: Game Theory 
Exercices related to Hawk-dove game, social dilemma and Games on finite population 

### Assignment 2: Complex networks
This assignment combines elements of complex networks and game theory. You will need to generate a Random network and a Scale free networks, analyze their degree distributions and finally simulate agents playing Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma on them and study how the network structure changes the cooperation.

### Assignment 3: Q-learning
Exercices related to N-Armed Bandit, Windy gridworld and Graphical Coordination Game
